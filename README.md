This project follows best practices for code style and type correctness using ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript.

npm run lint :
Runs ESLint and Prettier to check for:

Potential bugs and code smells

Code style violations (indentation, quotes, semicolons, etc.)

Unused variables or imports

Inconsistent formatting

You can also auto-fix most issues with:
npm run lint -- --fix


npm run type-check :
Runs TypeScript's type checker to ensure:

Type correctness across the codebase

Proper use of interfaces, types, and props

Zero unexpected runtime errors caused by incorrect typing

This command uses tsc --noEmit, meaning it doesn't compile the project â€” it only checks for type safety.
